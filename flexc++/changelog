flexc++ (0.93.00)

  * Redesigned the interactive scanner: no additional protected data members,
    an additional member (interactiveLine__) now handles the line-refresh from
    the input stream.

  * In interactive mode, lineNr() increments at each next interave line.

flexc++ (0.92.00)

  * Added 'leave(int retValue)' member that can be called from members called
    from the scanner specification's actions to end the action, returning
    'retValue' from 'lex()'

  * Sanitized switch- and pushStream members for interactive and
    non-interactive scanners

  * Added missing d_atBOL = true assignment in pushStream, detected by Jurjen
    Bokma.

  * All man-pages combined into one man-page: flexc++(1).

  * Implemented --filenames, --print-tokens and --own-tokens
    options/directives 

  * Manual and man-pages updated

flexc++ (0.91.00)

  * Jurjen Bokma found a segfault in action blocks at the end of files not
    ending in '\n'. Caused by Input's d_in == 0 after an earlier EOF
    detection, and then calling d_in->get(). Repaired by testing for d_in == 0

  * Added --target-directory option (and directive) to define where the
    generated files should be written if not at the default (lexer) location.

  * The earlier minor versions should have been .9 rather than .09. Same for
    the 0.08 series of changes. Version now (properly) set to 0.9x.yy.

flexc++ (0.09.52)

  * The Scannner(std::string infile, std::string outfile) and 
    switchStreams(std::string infile, std::string outfile) members now also 
    accept outfile == "", in which case std::cerr is used as the scanner's
    output stream.

flexc++ (0.09.51)

  * Rebased release.yo in flexc++'s main directory, and no longer in its
    parent, where it would contaminate  Debian's area outside of flexc++'s
    build-area. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 06 Feb 2012 21:11:42 +0100

flexc++ (0.09.50)

  * At the beginning of its Debian life-cycle, flexc++'s changelog is
    maintained again. This changelog does not reflect changes beyond version
    0.08.04 and before 0.09.50. Logs for those versions can be obtained using
    git. Currently (and until further notice) the primary git archive location
    is http://www.icce.rug.nl/git/flexc++.git. Flexc++'s official web location
    is http://www.flexcpp.org (badly in need of an update, though).
