To add a new regression test:

Define a file p<x> (<x>: digit(s)), 
    * giving a short explanation as C++ eoln comment as its first line(s),
    * followed by %%
    * followed by patterns.

Following a pattern simple actions may be written on the same line. Always use
    d_p="<the pattern>"
where <the pattern> is the pattern that's on this line. This allows the
scanner to show the pattern that was matched. 

When an action should return, return a small positive number.

The regression test script (run) adds skipping blanks and a pattern matching
all characters, returning -1. So if -1 is returned you know your p<x> file
didn't account for that character.


Also define an i<x> file, containing test-input. You should probably make sure
that your patterns match your test input

===================================================

The run script may be called with an explicit file argument or not, in which
case all p<x> patterns are run in sequence.

A first argument -d may be provided causing debug output to be shown. Debug
output is displayed interactively. After the program has read a char it shows
char, current matched() text, current state and char. range and waits for the
Enter key before continuing.
