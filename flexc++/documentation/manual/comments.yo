Flc() allows one to place comments anywhere in the document, indented or not.
Both multiline comments (tt(/* ... */)) and end of line comments (tt(// ...))
are supported.

When a multiline comment is encountered outside an action, flc() discards the
comment, while all comments in actions will be copied verbatim to the source.
