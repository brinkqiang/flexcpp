The rules section of the flc() input contains a series of rules of the form:

verb(pattern    action)

tt(action) is here an end-of-line comment, a single-line C-statement, or a
compound statement that may span several lines. tt(action) may also be empty.

An action consisting solely of a vertical bar (`|') means ``same as the action
for the next rule''.
